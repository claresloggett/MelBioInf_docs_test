## Where should I store my data? 

Large datasets are difficult to store and share on your local computer. A good option is to store data in the cloud. 


Options:

- store on a galaxy server (but check storage limits and policies)

- departmental server (check limits and policies)

- store on the nectar cloud (how to - swift storage?)
  - eg. your own galaxy(gvl) on the nectar cloud
